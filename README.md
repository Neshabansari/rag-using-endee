##  Project Overview

This project implements a **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that allows users to ask questions and receive answers grounded strictly in a given set of documents.

The core idea is to combine:
- **Semantic search** using vector embeddings
- **Endee** as the vector database
- **A local Large Language Model (LLM)** for answer generation

By retrieving only the most relevant documents and using them as context, the system avoids hallucinations and provides accurate, context-aware responses.

---

##  Problem Statement

Traditional language models generate answers based on general knowledge and may produce incorrect or hallucinated responses.

This project addresses that problem by:
- Retrieving relevant information from a **custom document set**
- Restricting the LLM to answer **only using retrieved context**
- Ensuring responses are explainable, accurate, and grounded

##  Use Case Demonstrated

- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
- **Semantic Search using vector similarity**

Vector search is the core of this application, making it suitable for:
- Knowledge base Q&A
- Internal document search
- Educational or enterprise AI assistants

##  System Design / Technical Approach

### High-Level Architecture

```

```

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Document Ingestion**
   - Text documents are loaded from a file.
   - Each document is converted into a vector embedding.

2. **Vector Storage**
   - Embeddings are stored using **Endee**.
   - Endee enables efficient similarity search over vectors.

3. **Query Processing**
   - User query is converted into an embedding.
   - Endee performs vector similarity search to retrieve relevant documents.

4. **Answer Generation**
   - Retrieved documents are passed as context to a local LLM.
   - The model generates an answer strictly based on that context.

##  How Endee is Used

**Endee acts as the vector database in this project.**

Specifically:
- Stores document embeddings
- Performs semantic similarity search
- Returns the most relevant documents for a given query

Endee is used as the **core retrieval layer**, making it central to the RAG workflow.

This project uses Endee via its Python interface to:
- Add vectors to the store
- Search vectors during query time

This screenshot demonstrates the complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation flow.
Relevant documents are retrieved using **Endee** and passed as context to the
local LLM, which generates a grounded and accurate response.


### ✅ Key Features
Uses Endee as the vector database

- Prevents hallucinations by enforcing context-based answers
- Fully local (no API keys required)
- Clean and interactive UI
- Optimized with embedding and vector-store caching
