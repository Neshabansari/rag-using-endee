Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language used to build platform-independent applications.
Java follows the principle of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" because Java code runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
The JVM is responsible for converting Java bytecode into machine-specific instructions and managing memory.
Java supports multithreading, which allows multiple tasks to run in parallel within a single program.
Threads in Java share memory, which improves performance but requires proper synchronization to avoid issues.
Java provides built-in support for concurrency using Thread, Runnable, ExecutorService, and synchronized blocks.
Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
Java is widely used for backend development, enterprise applications, Android development, and distributed systems.
Spring is a popular Java framework that simplifies application development by providing dependency injection.
Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring framework and simplifies backend development using auto-configuration.
Spring Boot is commonly used to build RESTful APIs for web and enterprise applications.
REST APIs built using Spring Boot support HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
Java applications are known for their performance, security, scalability, and strong community support.
